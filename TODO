Bugs
    -The application currently doesn't save from the compiled executable
        -Need to move the save file to the Streaming folder
    -Firefox will crash after a couple of different services are opened
        -Solution?

Features
    -Settings menu is still a little small. Need to increase it some more
    -Find a solution to keep the application open so that another service can be chosen without having to relaunch the application
