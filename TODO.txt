	-Modify the StreamingBackgrounds files to either just be the logo or fade out to transparent 
	-Add in some additional thunk or click like sounds for the drop down boxes
	-Create an icon for the application and set it in godot settings
	-Create a hero/long hero, grid, and logo for the steam artwork
